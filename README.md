# surfs_up

## Purpose

W. Avy  would like more information on temperature trends before opening a surf shop. Specifically, he wants June and December temperature data for Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream business is sustainable year round. Our mission is to perform a statistical analysis  for those two months and present the results of our analysis.

## Results
