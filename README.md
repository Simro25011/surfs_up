# surfs_up

## Purpose

W. Avy  would like more information on temperature trends before opening a surf shop. Specifically, he wants June and December temperature data for Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream business is sustainable year round. Our mission is to perform a statistical analysis  for those two months and present the results of our analysis.

## Results

### June Temperature

- The Average temperature is 75℉
 - The Min temperature is 64℉
  - the Max temperature is 85℉

### December Temperature

- The Average temperature is 71.℉
 - The Min temperature is 56℉
  - the Max temperature is 83℉


## Summary

Oahu has relatively consistent temperatures throughout the year, with a low probability of sustained precipitation. If we rewrite the query to add precipitation to the results for June and December, the average precipitation for those months appears as

The assumption is that neither  the temperature or the precipitations don't  have dramatic fluctuations throughout the year. Oahu is a sweet spot!
